> The Tinselwick Behavioral Records Authority has detected suspicious
> modifications to their Naughty & Nice database just weeks before
> Christmas Eve. Senior Archivist Frost suspects an insider
> breach—someone has tampered with behavioral records, audit logs, and
> registry entries in an attempt to alter the Nice List. She needs a
> skilled investigator to examine the TinselOS archives, compare current
> records against historical snapshots, trace unauthorized changes
> through the audit trail, and uncover the compromised CHILD_ID before
> Santa's final review. Flag Format: HTB{CHILD_ID} Example:

However, there are more ways to find the flag.
### Step 1: Inside the website, Click "Change Detector"
### Step 2: Compare Dec. 15, 18, or 21 to Dec. 22
Notice that `TC-5503 - Bramble Shadowpine` was the only one changed from **NAUGHTY** to **NICE**.

Since the Flag Format is `HTB{CHILD_ID}`, Replace the CHILD_ID with `TC-5503`.

**Flag: `HTB{TC-5503}`**
